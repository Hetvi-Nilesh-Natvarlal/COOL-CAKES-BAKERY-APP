COOL CAKES BAKERY APP


This project is an online bakery shop that allows users to search for and purchase various bakery
items available at the online shop. The project offers a variety of bakery products that are displayed
online in various categories. These items can be viewed by the user. If the user wishes to purchase a
product or products, he or she may do so by adding them to his or her shopping cart. An online bakery
shop software project, while retaining the features of an e-commerce site, acts as a central database
containing various bakery products. It allows customers to shop online from the comfort of their own
homes.

This project is created using the following :

XML as the frontend

JAVA as the backend 

FIREBASE as a database
